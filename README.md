## Project Summary

This project analyzes Flipkartâ€™s customer service interactions to identify key drivers of customer satisfaction, evaluate performance across different support channels, and develop actionable strategies to enhance the overall service experience.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes comprehensive records of customer interactions via multiple support channels (live chat, phone, email, social media), feedback (CSAT, CES, NPS, product reviews), and satisfaction scores. It also contains timestamps, issue types, resolution status, and textual customer remarks.

---

## Project Goals

- Identify factors impacting customer satisfaction through statistical and sentiment analysis  
- Understand performance differences across service teams and channels  
- Recommend improvements in workflows, agent training, technology use, and communication strategies

---

## Methodology

- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand query categories, channel usage, and sentiment trends  
- Sentiment analysis using VADER and TextBlob on textual feedback  
- Statistical hypothesis testing to validate relationships (e.g., sentiment vs. CSAT)  
- Machine learning classification (Random Forest) to predict customer satisfaction based on interaction features  
- Visualization of key metrics and model evaluation results

---

## Key Findings

- Most inquiries relate to **returns** and are initiated by customers.  
- Sentiment analysis shows mostly **neutral** feedback, with negative sentiment correlating with longer response times.  
- Morning shifts see higher customer satisfaction scores.  
- Response time strongly impacts customer sentiment and satisfaction.  
- Random Forest classifier achieves meaningful accuracy in predicting customer satisfaction from interaction features.

## Visualizations

- Support category and sub-category distributions  
- Channel-wise usage statistics  
- CSAT score and sentiment distribution plots  
- Word clouds of product categories and customer remarks  
- Correlation heatmaps and hypothesis testing results  
- Confusion matrix of classification results
